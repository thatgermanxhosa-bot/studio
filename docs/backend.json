    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to track clients, projects, bookings, quote requests, and testimonials for Pichulik Studios. The structure prioritizes authorization independence and supports secure list operations by leveraging structural segregation and path-based ownership. Each entity is stored in its own top-level collection, with subcollections used to represent one-to-many relationships (e.g., a Client can have multiple Projects). This approach facilitates simple, robust security rules.\n\nAuthorization Independence: The structure avoids hierarchical authorization dependencies by not relying on `get()` calls in security rules. For example, accessing projects does not require fetching the client document first. Instead, the `clientId` is directly available within each `Project` document.\n\nQAPs (Rules are not Filters): The data structure enables secure list operations (QAPs) through structural segregation and explicit ownership. Path-based ownership (e.g., `/clients/{clientId}/projects/{projectId}`) ensures that listing projects can be secured by verifying that the requesting user (or authenticated system) has access to the specified client's data.\n\nEach top-level collection can have specific security rules applied, ensuring data is appropriately protected based on entity type. The structure is designed to be scalable, debuggable, and to facilitate the implementation of comprehensive security rules."
